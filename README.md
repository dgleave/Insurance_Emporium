1: What is wrong with the component you chose?

I chose the Carousel component which is used to advertise key details.

I chose this as I believed there were 2 key areas in which it could be improved to make it more intuitive and also more user friendly as a whole.

Firstly, I believe one flaw in the desing is that to navigate between the items on the carousel, the user has to wither click and drag which is not immediately apparent.
For those that are not used to different methods of modern websites, this can be very constraining.
The other method of navigation is that of clicking between the buttins below the carousel which represent each item respectivvely. While this is an obvious method of navigation,
I believe that it is limited and requires the user to have semi decent dexterity to easily click upon the icons which may be difficult for more elderly customers.

Secondly, a flaw I saw was that, especially if the ammount of pages amongst the carousel increases, it may be difficult/annoying to find a page that the user previously
spotted that they may be interested in. While there are only 2 pages, this is not necessarily a problem but when the number increases, this can become more difficult.

2:How will you improve it?

To improve the carousel, I will implement two functions.

Firstly, I will add clear navigation arrows to either side of the carousel allowing for the easy navigation both left and right through the banners.

Secondly, I will add an option to view all present banners at once and then to select a specific one to be take to it directly in the carousel to allow for quick and
easy browsing.

3: Given more time what would you further improve?

If I was to have more time, I would first look to my own improvements and make them more dynamic in their funtionality.
Rather then having specific items hard coded, I would like to ensure they would update automatically. An example of this would be that if a new image is added
to a specific asset repository, this would automaticaly generate a new banner in the carousel. As well as this, a new navigation button would be added below to represent this.

I would also ensure that the visual design was more fitting with the asthetic of the website to ensure a pleasant experience for the customer.
